# TODO's

- Turn this project into a generic time series library. Possibly split up the repo into: core components, technical indicators, charting, etc. For now keeping it all in one works well enough.
- Explore the concept of creating a standardized time series stream specification.
- Find a new source for free time series data. Transition project to being more generally focused on time series data, regardless of source.
