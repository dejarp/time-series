# TODO's

- Turn this project into a generic time series library. Possibly split up the repo into: core components, technical indicators, charting, etc. For now keeping it all in one works well enough.
- Explore the concept of creating a standardized time series stream specification.
- Remove Bitfinex API keys, and republish to github as a public repo. Might need to get rid of the history as well, or just remove those keys directly in Bitfinex.
